# Flexible data transfer objects with validation, property whitelisting, and custom casts

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require mass/flexible-dto
```

## Usage

The aim of this package is to make it really easy to construct Data Transfer Objects with properties 
that are constrained to a whitelist that you specify in an array class member. Then, you can choose to pass in 
each property individually like a classic DTO, or via an associative array.


## Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
